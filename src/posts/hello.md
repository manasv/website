"Hello, Gastby?" after years without a clue, finally started building my website,
first phase to start this will be ***the blog***, and finally found the tool that will make this easier,
and freely hosted on **Netlify**, and this is **Gatsby**.

> Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps

As I'm learning it, will start crafting over an starter that's pretty clean for blogging as I'm developing the site.

For now in the blog you can expect a variety of topics, mainly my progress over becoming an iOS developer and things I learn
everyday, as a record of my progress, and other topics from **javascript, react, graphql, css** and every other aspect that let
me grow in my webdev skills and is reflected in the site.

I'll drop an fibonacci recursive code in Swift just for testing the syntax highlighing:

```swift

func fibonacci(number: Int) -> Int {
    
    if number == 0 {
        return 0
    } else if number == 1 {
        return 1
    }
    
    return fibonacci(number - 1) + fibonacci(number - 2)

}

```

See ya!
